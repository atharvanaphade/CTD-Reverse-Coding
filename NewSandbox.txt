Functioning :-
    1) User submits code through the api.
    2) code is saved in db by submission time
    3) parellely the code is run by the docker container with time and memory limits and the seccomp profile, and updates the code file name by its status after running
    4) For now java, python, c, cpp have been tested. More languages can be added later on it the project works correctly

Problems :-
    1) Building the container image is taking too much time, have to find something like ActiveMQ for storing the image's state to be used later on.
    2) Checking for constructive Algorithm Problems has not been solved
    3) The container image is ttaking too much space, need a way to decrease the size of the container.
